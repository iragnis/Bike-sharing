# Bike Sharing Demand using AutoGluon
This project has been developed as a part of a Nanodegree program wherein the bike sharing dataset from kaggle has to be trained using Autogluon.
## Dependancies
```
 Python 3.7
 Pandas >=1.2.4
 AutoGluon 0.2.0
```
## Installation
 * Amazon sagemaker is recommended for faster results (depending on the kernel chosen)
 * Alternatively jupyter notebook running on a local machine or Google Collab 
 can be used to achieve the same
 
For local development, you will need to setup a jupyter lab instance.

* Follow the jupyter install link for best practices to install and start a jupyter lab instance.
* If you have a python virtual environment already installed you can just ```pip``` install it.
```
pip install jupyterlab
```
